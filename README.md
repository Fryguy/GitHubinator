This will allow you to select text in a Sublime Text 2 file, and see the highlighted lines on the remote repo, if one exists.


## Caveats

This works for me on a Mac. I'm not sure it will for you in your environment. If you find that it doesn't, and then figure out how to make it work, I'm open to pull requests.


## Installation

Clone this repo to your Sublime Text 2 Packages folder:

    cd ~/"Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/"
    git clone https://github.com/ehamiter/ST2-GitHubinator.git

The plugin should be picked up automatically. If not, restart Sublime Text.


## Usage

Select some text.
Activate the context menu and select "GitHubinator" or by keypress (&#8984;\\ by default, configurable in .sublime-keymap file)
